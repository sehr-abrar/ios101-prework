**App Idea**

**Neighborly**, a social platform designed to help people connect within their local communities. The app allows users to stay informed about neighborhood events, share services or job opportunities, and discover local businesses through reviews and recommendations. With a community bulletin board and real-time updates on news and emergency alerts, Neighborly could foster a sense of belonging and engagement through finding nearby activities, coordinating neighborhood efforts, and keeping in touch with people in your local area.

## Notes

While working on my Xcode project, I encountered a challenge when I couldnâ€™t find the Main.storyboard file, only to realize I had accidentally switched to the Swift file editor instead of the storyboard view. Otherwise, everything else worked perfectly, and played around with the features afterwards.
